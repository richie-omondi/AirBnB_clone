### AirBnB Clone - The Console//Command Interpreter

## Description
This is a group project. It's the first step towards building a full web application: an AirBnB clone.
This first step consists of a custom command-line interface for data management and the base classes for the storage of this data.

## Functionalities of this command interpreter:

* Create a new object (ex: a new `User` or a new `Place`)
* Retrieve an object from a file or a database 
* Do operations on objects (`count`, `compute stats`, etc...)
* Update attributes of an object
* Destroy an object
  
## Environment

This project is interpreted/tested on `Ubuntu 14.04 LTS` using python3 (version 3.11.5)

## Installation

* Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/richie-oomondi/AirBnB_clone.git`
* Access AirBnb directory: `cd AirBnB_clone`
* Run hbnb(interactively): `./console` and enter command
* Run hbnb(non-interactively): `echo "<command>" | ./console.py`


## Tests

All the code is tested with the unittest module. The test for the classes are in the`test_models folder`.
